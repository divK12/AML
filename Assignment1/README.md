# Fashion MNIST and Emotion Detection Classifier

This repository contains implementations of two classification tasks using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**

## Tasks

### 1. Fashion MNIST Classification
- **Objective:** Classify the Fashion MNIST dataset into 3 broad categories:
  - Clothes
  - Shoes
  - Others
- **Approach:** Custom CNN architecture designed for this task.

### 2. Emotion Detection
- **Dataset:** Emotion recognition dataset.
- **Architecture:** ResNet-18.
- **Methods:**
  1. Training ResNet-18 from scratch.
  2. Fine-tuning a pretrained ResNet-18 model for improved performance.
