# Fashion MNIST and Emotion Detection Classifier

This repository contains implementations of two classification tasks using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
1. Classifying the Fashion MNIST dataset into 3 classes: clothes, shoes, and others.
2. Emotion Detection using the ResNet-18 architecture:
   - Training from scratch.
   - Fine-tuning a pretrained ResNet-18 model.
