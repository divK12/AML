## Assignment 1: CNN and ResNet Models
### Tasks:
1. **Fashion MNIST Classification:**
   - Classify Fashion MNIST images into 3 categories: clothes, shoes, and others.
   - Use a custom CNN model.

2. **Emotion Detection:**
   - Train and fine-tune a **ResNet-18** model for emotion detection:
     - **From scratch:** Train the ResNet-18 model with random initialization.
     - **Fine-tuning:** Use a pretrained ResNet-18 model for improved performance.

### Objectives:
- Compare the performance of models trained from scratch vs. fine-tuned.
- Analyze classification accuracy and example predictions.

## Assignment 2: SMS Spam Classification and Fashion MNIST cGAN
### Tasks:
1. **SMS Spam Classification & SMS completion:**
   - Models: 
     - **RNN-based Classifier**
     - **LSTM-based Classifier**
   - Objective: Compare the performance of RNN and LSTM models with a similar number of parameters. Provide example results.

2. **Fashion MNIST Conditional GAN:**
   - Model: **Conditional GAN (cGAN):**
     - **Generator:** Produces images based on a latent code and class label.
     - **Discriminator:** Classifies (Image, Label) pairs as real or fake.
   - Objective: Generate high-quality images for all 10 classes and showcase 4 examples per class.
